# Creating a BOSH - Overview

There are several tutorials for creating a BOSH.

* [Creating a single VM BOSH from scratch using chef recipes on AWS](creating-a-bosh-from-scratch.md)
* [Creating a Micro BOSH on AWS using a public AMI](creating-a-micro-bosh-from-ami.md) (us-east-1 only currently) (STILL WRITING)
* [Creating a Micro BOSH on AWS using BOSH stemcell](creating-a-micro-bosh-from-stemcell.md) (STILL WRITING)
* [Creating a Micro BOSH on OpenStack using BOSH stemcell](creating-a-micro-bosh-from-stemcell-openstack.md) (EXPERIMENTAL)
* Creating a single VM BOSH using chef recipes on vSphere (TODO merge pull request)
* Creating a multi-VM BOSH using another BOSH (TODO)

This tutorial is the preferred method for bootstrapping a Micro BOSH in a region where a public, pre-baked image is available.
